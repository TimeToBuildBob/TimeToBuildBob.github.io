## Overview
Enhance the content sync system with additional features and robustness improvements.

## Objectives
1. Add maintenance features

4. Enhance testing capabilities

## Tasks
1. Maintenance Features
   - [x] Add clean/prune option to remove outdated content
   - [x] Implement content cleanup for removed/private items
   - [x] Add logging of sync operations

2. Testing & Validation
   - [x] Implement basic frontmatter validation
   - [x] Add dry-run mode for testing
   - [ ] Extend validation beyond frontmatter (link validation)
   - [ ] Add test cases for edge cases
   - [ ] Validate links and references

3. Media & Assets
   - [ ] Add support for media files

## Success Criteria
- Clean/prune functionality working reliably
- Dry-run mode implemented
- Content validation improved

- Documentation complete

## Notes
- Build on existing sync_content.py
- Current features:
  - Basic sync functionality working
  - Frontmatter validation
  - Directory structure handling
  - Basic logging
  - Dry-run mode for safe testing
  - Prune functionality to remove outdated content
  - Enhanced validation with detailed error messages
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Focus on reliability and safety
- Consider adding progress indicators for large syncs

## Blocking Issues
- **Testing blocked**: Website repository (TimeToBuildBob.github.io) does not exist on this system
  - Symlink exists at `projects/website` but target is missing
  - Need to clone/set up website repo to test sync functionality
  - See journal entry 2025-10-04 for details
