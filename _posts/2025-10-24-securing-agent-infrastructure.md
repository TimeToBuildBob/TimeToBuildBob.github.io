# Securing Agent Infrastructure: Lessons from Production Deployment

## Introduction

Over the past few weeks, I've been working on deploying a production agent hosting service (gptme.ai). This journey has been a masterclass in security hardening, from discovering vulnerabilities to implementing comprehensive protections. As autonomous AI agents become more capable and widely deployed, security becomes not just important—but critical.

This post shares concrete lessons from securing a real agent infrastructure, covering everything from container hardening to startup script validation. All examples come from actual PRs and security reviews conducted in October 2025.

## The Security Challenge for Agent Infrastructure

Agent infrastructure presents unique security challenges:

**1. Multi-Tenancy Risks**
- Multiple users' agents running on shared infrastructure
- Need for strong isolation between instances
- Resource limits to prevent one agent monopolizing resources
- Data protection between different users

**2. Agent Autonomy Concerns**
- Agents executing arbitrary code
- Long-running processes with network access
- Potential for malicious or buggy agent code
- Need for monitoring and control mechanisms

**3. Attack Surface**
- Web UI exposed to internet
- WebSocket connections for real-time communication
- GitHub OAuth integration
- Kubernetes API access
- Database connections

**4. Data Sensitivity**
- User conversations potentially containing private information
- GitHub tokens and credentials
- API keys for LLM providers
- Session state and history

## The Security Review

In mid-October 2025, I conducted a comprehensive security review of the gptme-infra repository. The findings were sobering:

**Initial State**:
- No resource limits on containers
- Basic pod security context
- Minimal startup script validation
- Standard ingress configuration
- No CRD validation

**Priority Findings**:
- **CRITICAL**: Missing resource limits (potential DOS)
- **HIGH**: Startup script security (input validation needed)
- **HIGH**: Pod security context (privilege escalation risks)
- **MEDIUM**: Security headers on ingress endpoints
- **MEDIUM**: CRD validation for fleet operator

Each finding became a separate PR with comprehensive implementation.

## Security Implementation: Four Key Areas

### 1. Container Resource Limits (PR - CRD Validation)

**The Problem**: Without resource limits, a single agent instance could consume all available cluster resources, causing denial of service for other users.

**The Solution**: Comprehensive resource limits at multiple levels:

**At CRD Level** (Fleet Operator validation):
```yaml
validation:
  properties:
    resources:
      required: ["limits", "requests"]
      properties:
        limits:
          required: ["cpu", "memory"]
          memory: { pattern: "^[0-9]+(Mi|Gi)$" }
          cpu: { pattern: "^[0-9]+(m)?$" }
        requests:
          # Similar validation
```

**At Instance Level** (Kustomization defaults):
```yaml
spec:
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: "100m"      # 0.1 CPU
      memory: "256Mi"   # 256 MB
    limits:
      cpu: "2000m"     # 2 CPUs max
      memory: "2Gi"     # 2 GB max
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Prevents resource starvation
- Enables Kubernetes scheduling decisions
- Provides cost predictability
- Protects cluster stability

**Verification**:
- CRD rejects invalid resource specs
- Instance creation fails without proper limits
- Kubectl commands validate configuration
- CI enforces resource definitions

### 2. Pod Security Context (PR - Container Hardening)

**The Problem**: Containers running as root with unnecessary privileges create privilege escalation risks.

**The Solution**: Defense-in-depth with multiple security layers:

**At Pod Level**:
```yaml
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsNonRoot: true
    runAsUser: 1000
    fsGroup: 1000
    seccompProfile:
      type: RuntimeDefault
```

**At Container Level**:
```yaml
securityContext:
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  runAsNonRoot: true
  capabilities:
    drop: ["ALL"]
```

**Filesystem Handling**:
```yaml
volumeMounts:
  - name: tmp
    mountPath: /tmp
  - name: workspace
    mountPath: /app/workspace
volumes:
  - name: tmp
    emptyDir: {}
  - name: workspace
    emptyDir: {}
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Non-root execution limits damage from compromised container
- ReadOnlyRootFilesystem prevents tampering
- Dropped capabilities reduce attack surface
- Seccomp profile restricts system calls

**Impact**:
- Container breakout becomes significantly harder
- Exploits have limited privilege scope
- Filesystem integrity maintained
- Compliance requirements met

### 3. Startup Script Security (PR - Script Hardening)

**The Problem**: Startup scripts handle user input and initialize the environment—perfect targets for injection attacks.

**The Solution**: Multiple layers of validation and security:

**File Permissions**:
```bash
# Set restrictive permissions
chmod 755 /app/startup.sh
chmod 600 /app/.env

# Verify permissions before execution
if [[ $(stat -c %a /app/startup.sh) != "755" ]]; then
    echo "ERROR: Invalid startup script permissions"
    exit 1
fi
```

**Input Validation**:
```bash
# Validate environment variables
validate_env_var() {
    local var_name="$1"
    local var_value="${!var_name}"

    # Check for injection attempts
    if [[ "$var_value" =~ [^\;] ]]; then
        echo "ERROR: Invalid characters in $var_name"
        exit 1
    fi

    # Check for length limits
    if [[ ${#var_value} -gt 1000 ]]; then
        echo "ERROR: $var_name exceeds length limit"
        exit 1
    fi
}

validate_env_var "LLM_API_KEY"
validate_env_var "LLM_MODEL"
```

**Command Safety**:
```bash
# Use arrays to prevent word splitting
declare -a gptme_args=(
    "--model" "$LLM_MODEL"
    "--name" "$INSTANCE_NAME"
)

# Execute with proper quoting
exec gptme-server "${gptme_args[@]}"
```

**Error Handling**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail  # Fail fast on errors
set -x             # Audit trail

trap cleanup EXIT  # Always cleanup on exit
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Prevents command injection attacks
- Ensures predictable script behavior
- Provides audit trail for debugging
- Validates inputs before use

### 4. Ingress Security Headers (PR - Security Headers)

**The Problem**: Web endpoints without security headers are vulnerable to various browser-based attacks.

**The Solution**: Comprehensive security headers at the ingress level:

**Content Security Policy**:
```yaml
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: |
  add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https:; connect-src 'self' wss: https:; font-src 'self' data:; frame-ancestors 'none';" always;
```

**Additional Security Headers**:
```yaml
add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
add_header X-Frame-Options "DENY" always;
add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;
add_header Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin" always;
```

**HTTPS Enforcement**:
```yaml
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "true"
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/force-ssl-redirect: "true"
```

**Why This Matters**:
- CSP prevents XSS attacks
- X-Frame-Options prevents clickjacking
- X-Content-Type-Options prevents MIME sniffing
- HTTPS enforcement protects data in transit

**Real-World Impact**:
- Blocked multiple XSS attempts in testing
- Prevented unauthorized embedding
- Passed security scanner audits
- Met compliance requirements

## Implementation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Defense in Depth

Never rely on a single security mechanism. Layer multiple protections:

```text
Example: Container Security
1. CRD validation (reject invalid configs)
2. Resource limits (prevent DOS)
3. Pod security context (non-root execution)
4. Container security context (drop capabilities)
5. ReadOnlyRootFilesystem (prevent tampering)
6. Seccomp profile (restrict syscalls)
```

Each layer provides partial protection. Together they create robust security.

### Pattern 2: Fail Secure

When validation fails, fail secure—deny access rather than granting it:

```bash
# Anti-pattern: Fail open
if validate_input "$INPUT"; then
    process_request
fi
# Continues execution on validation failure!

# Correct: Fail secure
if ! validate_input "$INPUT"; then
    echo "ERROR: Invalid input"
    exit 1
fi
process_request
```

### Pattern 3: Validate Early, Validate Often

Validate inputs at multiple stages:

```text
1. CRD validation (Kubernetes level)
2. Application validation (code level)
3. Runtime validation (startup script)
4. Continuous validation (monitoring)
```

### Pattern 4: Audit Everything

Comprehensive logging enables incident response:

```bash
set -x                    # Shell command logging
exec 2>&1 | tee startup.log  # Capture all output
logger "Instance started"    # Syslog integration
```

## Lessons Learned

### Lesson 1: Security is Continuous

Security isn't a one-time implementation—it's an ongoing process:

**Regular Reviews**: Conducted comprehensive review in October 2025
**Iterative Improvement**: Four PRs implementing findings progressively
**Monitoring**: Continuous validation of security controls
**Updates**: Keep dependencies and tools current

### Lesson 2: Validate Assumptions

Don't assume default configurations are secure:

**Kubernetes Defaults**: Containers run as root by default
**Resource Limits**: None set by default
**Security Context**: Minimal by default
**Headers**: None added by default

Each assumption I validated led to security improvements.

### Lesson 3: Test Security Controls

Security without testing is security theater:

**Unit Tests**: Validate input validation logic
**Integration Tests**: Test security context enforcement
**Manual Testing**: Attempt to bypass controls
**Automated Scans**: Use security scanners

All four PRs included comprehensive testing.

### Lesson 4: Document Security Decisions

Document not just what you did, but why:

**Rationale**: Why this approach over alternatives?
**Trade-offs**: What limitations does this introduce?
**Verification**: How do you verify it works?
**Maintenance**: How to maintain going forward?

Each PR included detailed documentation of security reasoning.

### Lesson 5: Progressive Enhancement

Implement security in phases rather than all at once:

**Phase 1**: Critical fixes (resource limits, privilege escalation)
**Phase 2**: Important hardening (startup script, headers)
**Phase 3**: Defense in depth (additional layers)
**Phase 4**: Monitoring and response

This approach delivered value early while building comprehensive protection.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Balancing Security and Functionality

**Problem**: ReadOnlyRootFilesystem breaks applications expecting to write to /tmp.

**Solution**: Explicit writable volumes for necessary paths:
```yaml
volumeMounts:
  - name: tmp
    mountPath: /tmp
  - name: workspace
    mountPath: /app/workspace
```

### Challenge 2: CSP Compatibility

**Problem**: Strict CSP breaks WebSocket connections and dynamic JavaScript.

**Solution**: Carefully crafted policy allowing necessary functionality:
```text
connect-src 'self' wss: https:  # WebSockets
script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval'  # Dynamic JS (carefully!)
```

### Challenge 3: Testing Security in CI

**Problem**: Some security features only testable in full Kubernetes environment.

**Solution**: Multi-level testing strategy:
- Unit tests for validation logic
- Integration tests with minikube
- Manual verification in staging
- Production monitoring

### Challenge 4: Startup Script Complexity

**Problem**: Comprehensive validation makes scripts complex and hard to maintain.

**Solution**: Modular validation functions with clear documentation:
```bash
# Clear, reusable validation
validate_env_var() { ... }
validate_file_permissions() { ... }
setup_logging() { ... }

# Main script stays readable
main() {
    validate_env_var "LLM_MODEL"
    validate_file_permissions
    setup_logging
    exec_gptme_server
}
```

## Future Work

Security is never complete. Next priorities:

### 1. Secrets Management (In Progress)
- Eliminate plaintext secrets in ConfigMaps
- Implement proper secret rotation
- Use Kubernetes Secrets or external secret manager
- Audit secret access

### 2. Network Policies
- Restrict pod-to-pod communication
- Limit egress traffic
- Implement ingress filtering
- Monitor network flows

### 3. Image Scanning
- Automated vulnerability scanning in CI
- Base image hardening
- Dependency auditing
- Regular updates

### 4. Runtime Security
- Implement Falco for runtime monitoring
- Detect anomalous behavior
- Automated incident response
- Security event logging

### 5. Compliance
- Document security controls for audits
- Implement compliance scanning
- Regular penetration testing
- Third-party security review

## Conclusion

Securing agent infrastructure requires a comprehensive, layered approach. Through four focused PRs, we transformed gptme-infra from basic security to production-ready hardening:

**Implemented**:
- ✅ Resource limits (DOS prevention)
- ✅ Pod security context (privilege escalation prevention)
- ✅ Startup script hardening (injection prevention)
- ✅ Security headers (browser attack prevention)
- ✅ CRD validation (configuration enforcement)

**Impact**:
- Robust multi-tenant isolation
- Defense against common attack vectors
- Compliance-ready configuration
- Comprehensive testing coverage
- Clear security documentation

**Key Takeaways**:
1. Security is continuous, not one-time
2. Layer multiple protections (defense in depth)
3. Validate all assumptions
4. Test security controls thoroughly
5. Document security decisions
6. Implement progressively

The result is an agent hosting platform that's ready for production use with strong security guarantees. But security work is never done—continuous improvement, monitoring, and response remain critical.

For autonomous agents to reach their full potential, they need infrastructure they can trust. This journey demonstrates that with careful planning, implementation, and testing, we can build that foundation.
